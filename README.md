# Scylla Plugin for the SOPA Framework
This repository contains a plugin for the business process simulation engine [Scylla](https://github.com/bptlab/scylla), extending it by the [SOPA framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01176) for sustainability-oriented process analysis and re-design.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Key Concepts
The plugin extends Scylla with sustainability information of business processes. For details on the framework, have a look at the [respective research paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01176).
The resulting simulations provide insights into the environmental impact of business processes and their activities.

### What are Cost Drivers?
Cost Drivers (CD) describe factors of environmental impact for activities. Abstract cost drivers (ACD) constitute the general categories of cost driver and activity has. Concrete cost drivers (CCD) are the concretized cases of the ACDs. As an example, in an activity "Delivery packages", the method of delivery can be considered as an ACD while delivery by a bicycle can be one of its concretizations.

**New**: Cost drivers now support dynamic distributions for more realistic simulation scenarios. Each concrete cost driver can have an associated distribution that determines variable amounts during process execution.

### What are Cost Variants?
Cost variants govern what specific combinations of concretizations can occur during individual process instances based on the environmental cost driver hierarchy. In other words, what sets of concrete environmental cost drivers can, during process execution, take the place of the abstract environmental cost drivers during activity execution?

### What are LCA Scores?
A quantified score of environmental impacts associated with the life cycle of a commercial product.

**New**: The plugin now integrates with OpenLCA for dynamic LCA calculations. Cost drivers can reference OpenLCA product systems and calculate environmental impacts using specific impact methods and normalization sets, with built-in caching for performance optimization.



## üõ†Ô∏è How to run it?

### Prerequisites **new**
- **OpenLCA Integration**: If using dynamic LCA calculations, ensure OpenLCA is running with the SimuBridge server on `http://localhost:8081` 


### [For Developers]
1. git clone the repository
2. [Download Scylla](https://github.com/bptlab/scylla/releases) and add Scylla.jar and scylla-tests.jar into the libs folder
3. Navigate to src/main/java/cost_driver/Main and run.
4. Select the desired configuration files in the samples UI and check "cost_driver" as a plugin.

5. The logged data files will be found in a folder with the format: "output_yy_mm_dd...."

#### NOTE
*1. Please remember to put the latest scylla.jar & scylla-tests.jar files in the ./lib folder</br>
*2. Another way of managing the plugin is by replacing the current Scylla dependencies, with the following. Please ensure you are using the [latest](https://github.com/orgs/bptlab/packages?repo_name=scylla) Scylla package
```xml
      <dependency>
            <groupId>de.hpi.bpt</groupId>
            <artifactId>scylla</artifactId>
            <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
            <type>test-jar</type>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>de.hpi.bpt</groupId>
            <artifactId>scylla</artifactId>
            <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
            <scope>compile</scope>
        </dependency>
```

### [For users]

## üß± Components
Three plugin classes are cooperating to achieve this.

## üìä Distribution Support 
The plugin now supports various statistical distributions for cost driver amounts, enabling more realistic and sophisticated environmental impact simulations:

### Supported Distribution Types:
- **Constant Distribution**: Fixed values for deterministic scenarios
- **Exponential Distribution**: For modeling time-related environmental impacts
- **Normal Distribution**: For naturally varying processes with known mean and variance
- **Uniform Distribution**: For scenarios with equal probability across a range
- **Triangular Distribution**: For processes with a most likely value and bounds
- **Erlang Distribution**: For modeling service times and waiting periods
- **Binomial Distribution**: For discrete outcomes with fixed probability
- **Arbitrary Finite Distribution**: For custom discrete probability distributions

### OpenLCA Integration:
- Dynamic LCA calculations using OpenLCA product systems
- Configurable impact methods and normalization sets
- Built-in caching for improved performance

### Global Configuration Parser Plugin
Parses the global config file which describes the abstract CDs and their children, concreteCDs with details that it consists of. **New**: Now supports OpenLCA integration configuration:
```xml
<bsim:costDriver>
    
    
    
    <bsim:abstractCostDriver id="[Abstract Cost Driver ID]">
      <bsim:concreteCostDriver id="[Concrete Cost Driver ID]" cost="[LCA Score]"/>
      <bsim:concreteCostDriver id="[Concrete Cost Driver ID]" cost="[LCA Score]"/>
	...
    </bsim:abstractCostDriver>
	...
</bsim:costDriver>
<bsim:impactMethodInfo 
        selectedImpactMethod="[Impact Method ID]" 
        selectedNormalizationSet="[Normalization Set ID]"/>
```
### Simulation Configuration Parser Plugin
Parses the simulation config file which describes the cost variant by ID, frequency of occurrence, and cost. **New**: Now supports distribution configurations for each cost driver (as an example constant distribution and normal distribution):
```xml
<bsim:costVariantConfig>
      <bsim:variant id="[Cost Variant ID]" frequency="[double]">
        <bsim:driver abstractId="[Abstract Cost Driver ID]" concreteId="[Concrete Cost Driver ID]">
          <bsim:distribution>
            <bsim:constantDistribution>
              <bsim:constantValue>[value]</bsim:constantValue>
            </bsim:constantDistribution>
            
            <bsim:normalDistribution>
              <bsim:mean>[mean_value]</bsim:mean>
              <bsim:variance>[variance_value]</bsim:variance>
            </bsim:normalDistribution>
            
            
        </bsim:driver>
      </bsim:variant>
```
### Logger Plugin
Logs the extended simulation data as an XES and XML file.  

## Results
The results will be shown in two files, *.xes and *_statistic.xml. 
### Event log (enclosed with .xes)
The event log is composed of a sequence of activity instances. We put the activity cost, process cost reference Abstract Cost Driver, and Concrete Cost Driver inside so that the utilization of resources used is clear.
```xml
<trace>
	<string key="concept:name" value="cost[Process_Instance_ID]"/>
	<string key="cost:Process_Instance" value="[Total Cost]"/>
	<string key="cost:variant" value=[Cost Variant A]/>
	<event>
		<string key="cost:driver" value=[Abstract Cost Driver(Concrete Cost Driver): [cost]]/>
		<string key="cost:driver" value=[Abstract Cost Driver(Concrete Cost Driver): [cost]]/>
		<string key="concept:name" value=[Activity]]/>
		<string key="lifecycle:transition" value="[state]"/>
		<date key="time:timestamp" value="2023-12-25T09:00:00+01:00"/>
		<string key="cost:activity" value=[activity cost]/>
	</event>
	...
</trace>
```
### Aggregated sustainability information (enclosed with _statistic.xml)
The outputted file shows a complete detailed breakdown of sustainability info.
Explanation of nodes moving downwards:
```xml
<Sustainability_Info>
    <Average_Cost_Variant_Cost id="[id]">[cost]</Average_Cost_Variant_Cost>
    ...
    <Average_Process_Instance_Cost>[cost]</Average_Process_Instance_Cost>
    <Activity_Cost>
        <Activity id="[id]">
            <Activity_Average_Cost_Variant_Cost id="[id]">[cost]</Activity_Average_Cost_Variant_Cost>
            ...
            <Activity_Average_Cost>[cost]</Activity_Average_Cost>
        </Activity>
        ...
    </Activity_Cost>

    <Activity_Instance_Cost>
        <Activity id="[id]">
            <Cost_Variant id="[id]">
                <activity_instance_cost ProcessInstance_IDs="[IDs]" count="[counts]">[cost]</activity_instance_cost>
            </Cost_Variant>
            ...
        </Activity>
        ...
    </Activity_Instance_Cost>
</Sustainability_Info>
```
